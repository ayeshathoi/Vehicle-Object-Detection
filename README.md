## Dataset 

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dl-enigma-10-sust-cse-carnival-2024/data) covers the following 9 districts in Bangladesh: Sylhet, Dhaka, Rajshahi, Mymensingh, Maowa, Chittagong, Sirajganj, Sherpur, and Khulna. This dataset contains 9825 images with 78,943 Objects with 13 different classes. It is annotated with rectangular bounding box.Participants will encounter a wide range of road types, including towns, expressways, highways, and village roads. This diversity in locations aims to challenge algorithms to perform well across various driving contexts commonly encountered on Bangladesh roads.
