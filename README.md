In this project, we tackle the unique and complex task of object detection in diverse driving environments across 9 districts in Bangladesh.
We tried Transfer Learning with 3 different solutions. Specifically, we investigate the performance of different YOLO configurations, from YoloV6L6 to the advanced YoloV8, alongside novel transformer-based models like rtDETR and CoDETR. We also tried faster-rcnn.
