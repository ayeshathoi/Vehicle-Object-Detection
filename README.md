In this project, we address the unique and complex task of object detection in diverse driving environments across nine districts in Bangladesh. We employed transfer learning using three different approaches. Specifically, we investigated the performance of various YOLO configurations, ranging from YOLOv6L6 to the advanced YOLOv8, as well as novel transformer-based models such as rtDETR and CoDETR. Additionally, we explored the application of Faster R-CNN.
